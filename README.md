# CellMigrationSPP
Code associated with "Semblance of Heterogeneity in Collective Cell Migration", Schumacher et al., 2017, Cell Systems 5, 1â€“9, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.06.006

This code may use some external bits of code from the Matlab file exchange (eg exportfig for saving figures). If you notice anything that is missing, please raise an issue and I will add it to the repository.

For re-plotting the figures, you may have to generate some results first. Results of delay correlation analysis have been provided in .mat files. Raw simulation results can be shared on request.

The following scripts are used for the figures in the paper:

Fig1: compareTrajectories.m

Fig2A: compareDelayDistribution.m

Fig2B: plotDelayDistributionIndividuals.m

Fig2C: plotDelayDistribution.m

Fig2D: plotDelayDistributionWithLeaders.m

FigB1: plotDelayDistributionExpmntComparison

Fig3A: plotTrajectories.m

Fig3B-D: plotTrajectoriesConfined.m

Fig3E-F: compareDelayDistributionConfined.m

FigS2: forcePlot.m

FigS3: plotPhaseDiagram.m

FigS4:plotBoundaryDetection.m and plotDelayDistributionBoundary.m
